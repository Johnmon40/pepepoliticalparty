    <h1>💊 FROM SHITCOINS TO STATESMAN: THE RISE OF DOC PEPE 🐸📈</h1>
    <p><strong>He Degenned Too Close to the Sun — And Set It on Fire</strong></p>
    <p>Before they called him Mr. President, they called him Doc — not because he had a degree, but because he’d performed more open-heart rugs than anyone on-chain and lived to screenshot the profits.</p>
    <p>Doc Pepe wasn’t born in a lab. He was minted in the depths of a bear market, forged by leverage, and hardened by liquidation wicks. A meme coin maniac turned perpetuals sniper, he cut his teeth flipping 5-figure $PEPE bags into islands while others fumbled bag after bag. He doesn’t just buy bottoms—he becomes the bottom. And when he calls a top, markets crash out of respect.</p>
    <h2>🧠 THE BITCOIN WHISPERER</h2>
    <p>They say Doc once shared a motel room with Satoshi—just two shadowy superposters chain-smoking copium and writing the earliest Bitcoin protocol on a diner napkin. Satoshi vanished soon after. Doc didn’t. Instead, he started shitposting his way into legend.</p>
    <h2>🛥️ THE ISLAND OF ALPHAS</h2>
    <p>Doc’s personal island in the Maldives isn’t just a flex—it’s an offshore citadel where the elite come to simp.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elon offered him Starlink satellites in exchange for a whitelist spot.</li>
      <li>Andrew Tate called him “the only true Top G.”</li>
      <li>Miley Cyrus got a $PPP tramp stamp and didn’t even ask for SOL.</li>
      <li>Even Warren Buffett showed up and left with a Pepe tattoo and a Referral code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📉 THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE 100x</h2>
    <p>Doc Pepe doesn’t campaign. He goes long on himself and shorts the establishment. He doesn’t shake hands. He sends gasless memos. He doesn’t do debates. He opens the chart and lets it speak.</p>
    <p>Every rug pulled, every scam dodged, every Perp he rode from $500 to Lambo—all of it led to this moment. The frogs didn’t choose Doc. The blockchain anointed him.</p>
    <blockquote><strong>🔥 “He once turned $69 into $6.9M on a single trade and never sold. That’s a leader.”<br>— CZ, Binance (on a burner account)</strong></blockquote>
    <p>✅ Vote Doc Pepe<br>⚖️ “Decentralized. Deranged. Destined.”<br>🧪 Powered by $PPP. Backed by vibes.</p>
