    <h2>FROM SHITCOINS TO STATESMAN: THE LEGEND OF DOC PEPE</h2>

    <img src="docpepe-origins.png" alt="President Pepe Yacht Party in the Maldives" />

    <p>They laughed when he aped into a 12x long on a meme coin named after a fart.<br>
    They scoffed when he minted his own token with zero utility, infinite supply, and a roadmap written in Wingdings.</p>

    <p>Now they salute him from yachts docked outside <strong>Pepe Island</strong>—his private, tax-free dominion nestled in the Maldives, where the sun never sets on his trades and the parties never end.</p>

    <p>Doc Pepe didn’t just survive the crypto trenches.<br>He <em>conquered</em> them.</p>

    <p>Birthed from the darkest corners of meme culture and hardened by 1000x degens and soul-crushing liquidations, Pepe rose through the ranks of digital warfare. A wizard of the perps. A god of leverage. A prophet of pump.</p>

    <p>While influencers were peddling rugs and whales were dumping bags, Doc Pepe was flipping 100 SOL into a small navy, buying up coral reefs, and launching <strong>$PPP</strong> from a satellite made of diamond hands.</p>

    <p>Now, surrounded by celebrities, rogue world leaders, exiled billionaires, and the ghost of Satoshi, President Pepe rules with a golden fist and a green grin. His cabinet is handpicked from the finest minds on Telegram and X. His policies are written in memes, ratified by vibes, and enforced by airdrops.</p>

    <p>He is the signal in the noise.<br>The candle that never wicks.<br>The frog that became a god.</p>

    <p><strong>This isn’t politics. This is prophecy.<br>This is the Pepe Political Party.</strong></p>
