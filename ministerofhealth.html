  <h2 class="section-title">How Nixon Got Elected – The Meme Chef of the Pepe Political Party</h2>

  <p>While other candidates were kissing babies, Nixon was chopping wood, roofing houses, and flipping steaks at a rooftop bar—and still finding time to drop world-class memes that made even the harshest trolls cry-laugh.</p>

  <p>He didn’t just out-meme the world. He out-lived it.</p>

  <p>Every meme he posted felt like it was forged in the fires of crypto lore and shitposts, and the smoke was a man with unmatched hustle and—most importantly—flavor. His enemies asked for seconds.</p>

  <p>By day, he crafted memes sharper than a chainlink fudder’s tears. By night, he was serving up handcrafted health elixirs and ribeye tacos that would’ve unmasked just for a bite. His kitchen? Pure chaos. Flames, spice, and precision. Beauty every time.</p>

  <p>In the end, it wasn’t just the memes or the hammer or the rooftop bar vibes. It was Nixon’s ability to make the blockchain feel like brunch.</p>

  <p>And that’s how Nixon became Minister of Health—because nothing heals like flavor, memes, and heat.</p>
