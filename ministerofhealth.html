    <h1>Minister of Health: Nixon</h1>
    <h2>How Nixon Got Elected – The Meme Chef of the Pepe Political Party</h2>
    <p>While other candidates were kissing babies, Nixon was chopping wood, roofing houses, running the local meme bar—and still finding time to drop world-class memes that made even the most jaded shitcoiners whisper “based.”</p>
    <p>He didn’t just out-meme the world. He out-lived it.</p>
    <p>Every meme he posted felt like it was forged in the fires of crypto lore and seasoned with sarcasm. But behind the shitposts and the smoke was a man with unmatched hustle and—most importantly—a salad game so strong it had enemies asking for seconds.</p>
    <p>By day, he crafted memes sharper than a chainlink fudder’s tears. By night, he grilled tacos so divine even Satoshi would've unmasked just for a bite. His kitchen? Pure chaos. Flames, spice, laughter, and somehow, perfectly plated beauty every time.</p>
    <p>In the end, it wasn’t just the memes or the hammer or the rooftop bar vibes. It was the cilantro-lime sauce.</p>
    <p>And that’s how Nixon became Minister of Health—because nothing heals a nation like a damn good taco.</p>
