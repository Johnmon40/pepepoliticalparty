    <p><strong>Why President Pepe Appointed Wif as Secretary of Rugs</strong></p>

    <p>When it came time to appoint the Secretary of Rugs, President Pepe didn’t want someone “qualified.” He wanted someone dangerous. Enter Wif—a man who once turned a meme coin into a Ponzi scheme on accident, then tripled investor returns just to flex.</p>

    <p>Wif doesn’t inspect rugs—he lays them, pulls them, and sometimes even sleeps under them. He once sold a coin called “RUGGED” with a 99% tax, and people still bought it. His cowboy hat? Stolen from a Texan VC. His glasses? CryptoKitties limited edition. His handshake? Carries more red flags than a Binance altcoin on launch day.</p>

    <p>Pepe knew the role required a man immune to shame, allergic to ethics, and fluent in liquidity extraction. Wif was the only choice. With a briefcase full of broken dreams and liquidity pool receipts, Wif accepted the job with one condition: no questions, no refunds, and absolutely no morals.</p>

    <p>The rug is not safe. But it is now… federal policy.</p>
